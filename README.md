Zerochain is a privacy-preserving blockchain on substrate. 
It is designed to get efficient zero-knowledge proving, reduce the on-chain storage cost and bring the flexibility for developing applications.

## Status
**WARNING: Zerochain is alpha quality software, improvements and fixes are made frequently, and documentation for technical details doesn't yet exist.**

For now, only supported for the "confidential payment PoC".

- Balance for each account is encrypted

More features will be added... :muscle::muscle:

## Usage
### Initial Setup
```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh

rustup update stable
rustup update nightly
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
cargo +nightly install --git https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasm-gc
```
You will also need to install the following packages:
- Mac:
```
brew install cmake pkg-config openssl git llvm
```
- Linux:
```
sudo apt install cmake pkg-config libssl-dev git clang libclang-dev
```

### Building
```
git clone git@github.com:LayerXcom/zero-chain.git
cd zero-chain
./build.sh
cargo build --release
```

## A brief tutorial for Sending transactions
This tutorial will explain the basic confidential transfer on Zerochain. Alice has the **encrypted** balance of 100 coins and sends **encrypted** 10 coins to Bob. So, Alice's balance will be 90 coins and Bob will get the 10 coins. All operations are done encrypted by ElGamal encryption and zk-SNARKs.

1. Setup for zkSNARKs from CLI
- Get the proving key and the veifying key for zk-SNARKs
```
./target/release/zero-chain-cli setup
```

2. Run the nodes
```
./target/release/zero-chain --dev
```
- If you want to clear your old chain's history:
```
./target/release/zero-chain purge-chain --dev
```

3. Run the UI apps

The UI repository is here:
https://github.com/LayerXcom/zero-chain-ui

4. Generate the transaction from CLI
- Generate the transaction components (Computing a zero-knowledge proofs and an encryption)
```
./target/release/zero-chain-cli generate-tx
```

- For more information (if you want to set the customized amount and address)
```
./target/release/zero-chain-cli generate-tx --help
```

5. Fill out the form:

You can send the transaction from firefox browser.
